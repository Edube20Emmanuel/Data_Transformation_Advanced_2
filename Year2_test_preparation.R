## Counting some categorical columns

### Carring out some summary statistics
summary(df2)

summary(df2$Total_Price)
columns <- names(df2)
## Dealing with missing values
Stats <- function(data){

## Plotting only numeric columns
Box_plot <- function(data){

    if (is.double(data[[col]])){
      boxplot(df[[col]], main = col)
    }
    
  }
}

### Creating my own function
box <- function(data){
  ## Get the columns in the data
  columns <- names(data)
  ## setting the columns in the plot
  num_cols <- 3
  ## Setting the number of rows
  num_rows <- ceiling(length(columns) / num_cols)
  # Set up the plotting area
  par(mfrow = c(num_rows,num_cols))
  for (col in columns){
    if(is.numeric(data[[col]])){
      boxplot(data[[col]],main = col,xlab = col,col = "blue")
    }
  }
  par(mfrow = c(1,1))  # Reset plotting area to defualt
}
box(df2)

## Function to plot a multiple histogram
hist_plot <- function(data){
  # Finding the columns in the data set
  columns <- names(data)
  # Setting the number of columns in the data set
  num_cols <- 3
  # Calculating the number of rows in the plot
